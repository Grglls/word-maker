# Word-Maker In Browser Game - Version 1.0
https://grglls.github.io/word-maker/

This project is a broswer version of a game where players create words out of the provided letters. It is made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The game adopts the Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach for the code's architecture.

## How to Play:
* Create as many words as possible using the 7 letters provided.
* The letter in the center MUST be used in every word.
* Letters may be used more than once.
* Type on the keyboard or click the letters on screen to build a word.
* Press enter on the keyboard or click the 'Check' button to submit a guess.
* Click the play again button to start a new game.

## Known Bugs:
* Set of letters are placed in the same order that they came from the originating word (except for the 'key' letter), meaning that it is easier to guess the full word.

## Future Development:
### Short Term:
* Messages upon guessing a word.
* Message on game end.
* Improve CSS.
* Button to shuffle letters.

### Long Term:
* Points tracking.
* Daily mode.
